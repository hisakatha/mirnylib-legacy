HOWTO make mirnylab available for import in Python:

On Linux:
    - execute 'install_linux.py'

On Windows:
    - Go to My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings >
      Environment Variables. If PYTHONPATH exist, add the absolute path to
      mirnylab folder after a semicolon. If PYTHONPATH doesn't exist, click
      'New...' and create a variable 'PYTHONPATH' with the absolute path to
      mirnylab as a value.
