restriction fragment - a fragment between two sites of restriction

ligation junction - a site of enzymatic ligation between two restriction 
                    fragments, located close to each other in the nucleus.
                    For strictly enzymatic cuts, it has a canonical sequence,
                    determined by the restrictase. In reality, random breaks
                    occur, so the junction sites may have different sequences.

ultra-sonic cut site - a position of ultra-sonic shear site, closest to the 
                       ligation junction. Also, the first position of the 
                       mapped sequence.

ultra-sonic fragment (a.k.a. Hi-C molecule) -
    a DNA fragment sequenced in Hi-C experiment. The Hi-C experiment is designed
    to sequence only the fragments that are formed by two ultra-sonic cuts and
    contain a ligation junction. However, the specificity is not 100%,
    so the collection of sequenced molecules may contain dangling ends and
    self-circles.

Hi-C library - a collection of sequenced Hi-C molecules

read - the sequences of both ends (sides) of a Hi-C molecule

sides of a read - a sequence of one end of a Hi-C molecule. Usually, the sides
                  are numbered, e.g. "the first side" and "the second side".

strand - the genomic strand the side of a read was mapped to. Can be 'forward' 
         or 'reverse'.

upstream, downstream - ...

single-sided read - 

double-sided read - 

dangling end -

self-circle - a self-circulized ligation product.
